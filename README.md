# Project Showcase: Random User Display
### This project demonstrates my ability to work with JavaScript and API integration to dynamically fetch and display user data. The core functionality involves fetching random user data from the Random User API and presenting it in a structured format on a webpage.

## Key Features:

### API Integration: The project fetches data from the Random User API, retrieving information about 10 random users.  
Dynamic Content: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically create and display user profiles, including their names, ages, and photos.  
DOM Manipulation: Efficiently manipulates the DOM to display user information within a designated container (#user-container).  
Error Handling: Implements error handling to manage and log any issues that arise during the data fetching process.  

## Technologies Used:  

HTML: Structures the webpage and includes a container for displaying user information.  
CSS: Styles the user profiles for better visual presentation.  
JavaScript: Handles data fetching, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content creation
